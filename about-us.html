            <h2>Our Mission</h2>
            <p>We aim to help students learn more about the destinations they can choose for the next semester, focusing on environmental impact and cultural insights.</p>
            <p>EcoTrails is designed to provide a comprehensive overview of each destination, including its environmental practices, cultural significance, and travel tips.</p>
            <p>We believe that understanding the environmental and cultural aspects of a destination is crucial for making informed travel choices.</p>
