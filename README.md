Our idea is to take the destinations dedicated to the S5 at Efrei Paris and give the pros and cons list, focusing on ecology.

- Transports used to go there 
- Transports you can use there
- Types of enegeries used in the country
- Position regarding internationals agreement 
- What is the school doing for its "RSE" policy
- What is done is the city (civil engineering, policy etc.)
