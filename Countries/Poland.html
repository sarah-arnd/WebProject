        <h2>🚆 Transport to Get There</h2>
  <p>Kraków is accessible by train (from Central Europe), long-distance bus (e.g., Flixbus), and by air (via John Paul II International Airport). Trains are the most sustainable option, it more expensive than flying but the carbon footprint is much lower, also it contributes to develop the European train infrastructure.
    Bus are the second best option on carbon footprint and the first on price but can take a long time and is not the most comfortable.
  </p>

  <h2>🚲 Transport Available in and from the City</h2>
  <p>The city has an efficient electric tram and bus network, bike lanes, and a public bike-sharing system. Public transport is well-developed and relatively low in emissions. Poland is also really well connected to the nearby countries by train so you can easily travel from country to country at a low carbon footprint !</p>

  <h2>⚡ National Energy Mix</h2>
  <p>Poland still relies heavily on coal (around 70%) for electricity production, although efforts are being made to expand solar and wind energy it is still one of the most polluting way of making electricity.</p>

  <h2>📜 International Agreements</h2>
  <p>Poland is a member of the European Union and a signatory of the Paris Agreement, but has often been criticized for its slow transition from coal dependency.</p>

  <h2>🏫 School Sustainability (RSE Policy)</h2>
  <p>The EFREI partnrer university in Kraków, AGH University of Science and Technology, has sustainability initiatives: renewable energy research, eco-friendly campus transport, recycling, and more.</p>

  <h2>🏗️ Local City Actions</h2>
  <p>Kraków has implemented a low-emission zone, invested in electric trams, and promotes urban greening. It has received national recognition for environmental initiatives.</p>

  <h2>🧾 Overall</h2>
  <p>Many efforts are being made in Poland and it is definitly one of the most eco-friendly destinations but there is still work to be done, especially concerning the energy production.</p>
